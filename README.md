# House Price Prediction

## Project Description
The problem statement for this project is to predict the final sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using machine learning algorithms based on the explanatory variables in the dataset. The target variable is `SalePrice`, which represents the property's sale price in dollars.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project consists of two files:
- train.csv - This file contains the training and testing set.
- data description.txt - This file contains a full description of each column in the dataset.

The train.csv file contains 1460 rows and 80 columns, including the target variable SalePrice.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) here.
</br>
You will also need to have Anaconda on your machine. You can download the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) here.

### Installing
Clone this repository onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAhmedSuhail/House-Price-Prediction.git
```

## Modeling
Finally, I build machine learning models to predict the sale price of homes.I started by training a simple linear regression model and then move on to more advanced models such as random forest and gradient boosting. I evaluated models using various metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict the sale price of homes. We've used the Ames Housing dataset to train and evaluate various machine learning models and have achieved a good accuracy in our predictions. We hope that this project provides some insight into the exciting world of machine learning and inspires you to explore further.
